SPRINT 7 REACT - BUDGET

EX1 - array for the state of 3 checkboxes and a state for the total budget 
 
EX2 - budget incluiding a panel for web to estimate extra pages and languages

EX3 - on web panel, replacing interactivity with a component that contains buttons and an input to add quantities

EX4 - saving in localstorage

EX5 - navigation with React Router - Welcome and Budget components

EX6 - info popup at web page budget section

EX7 - budget identification, customer, date and printing the list of budgets if any budget exists

EX8 - sort budgets by their names or the date they were created, and a reset button.

EX9 - search of budgets by their names
      I add a search button to aloud looking for characters included in the budget names.

/// NOTE ::: between ex7 to ex9 :::
      In terms of validating the form to print the list, initially I was not limiting repetitions, then I limited the availability of repeating budgets names (and was using budget names as key), later on I removed that option, and included an id for each budget object (and used it as key).
      
      Finally I switched the 'strategy' for a validation of customer and budget name inputs to avoid empty inputs; and a specific customer could not have budgets with repeated names.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
